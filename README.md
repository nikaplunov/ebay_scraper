## Project Overview

Gift cards have become a significant component of consumer spending, often regarded as cash equivalents due to their direct monetary value. Understanding their secondary market dynamics, especially on platforms like eBay, provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and market efficiency. This project aims to shed light on these aspects by systematically collecting and analyzing auction data.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Gathers live auction listings for gift cards within eBay's Gift Cards category (Category ID: 172008).
- **Detailed Information Extraction**: Captures essential details including:
  - Seller's username and feedback score
  - Item ID and title
  - Extracted gift card value from the title
  - Current bid amount and bid count
  - Shipping cost
  - Auction end time
  - Item condition
  - Direct URL to the listing
- **Pagination Handling**: Automatically navigates through all available auction pages to ensure complete data retrieval.
- **Data Storage**: Saves the aggregated data into a structured CSV file (`ebay_gift_card_auctions.csv`) for subsequent analysis.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ebay-gift-card-scraper.git
   cd ebay-gift-card-scraper
   ```

2. **Install Required Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas
   ```

3. **Obtain eBay OAuth Token**:
   - Register for the [eBay Developer Program](https://developer.ebay.com/).
   - Create an application to generate your OAuth access token.

4. **Configure API Credentials**:
   - Replace `"Your OAuth TOKEN"` in the script with your obtained OAuth access token.

## Usage Guide

Execute the scraper script:

```bash
python ebay_gift_card_scraper.py
```

Upon completion, the collected auction data will be available in the `ebay_gift_card_auctions.csv` file for analysis.

## Research Objectives

This project is designed to facilitate research into several key areas:

- **Price Dispersion Analysis**: Investigate how gift cards, despite being cash equivalents, exhibit varying price points in secondary markets. Jennifer Pate Offenberg's study, ["Markets: Gift Cards"](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/jep.21.2.227), provides foundational insights into this phenomenon.

- **Market Liquidity Examination**: Assess the ease with which gift cards from different retailers are sold in secondary markets and how this liquidity impacts their pricing.

- **Bidding Behavior Insights**: Analyze patterns such as auction sniping and the effect of seller reputation on final sale prices.

These objectives build upon existing literature, including the work by Lesley Chiou and Jennifer Pate titled ["Internet Auctions and Frictionless Commerce: Evidence from the Retail Gift Card Market"](https://ideas.repec.org/a/kap/revind/v36y2010i3p295-304.html), which explores online auction dynamics for gift cards.

## Important Considerations

- **API Rate Limiting**: To comply with eBay's API usage policies, the script includes a `time.sleep(1)` delay between requests to prevent exceeding rate limits.

- **Category Specification**: The scraper targets the Gift Cards category (Category ID: 172008) by default. Adjust this parameter if you wish to explore other categories.

- **Token Validity**: Ensure your OAuth token is active and has not expired (tokens typically have a limited validity period).

## Future Enhancements

- **Automated Token Refresh**: Implement functionality to handle OAuth token expiration and renewal seamlessly.

- **Data Cleaning and Validation**: Enhance data preprocessing to handle anomalies and ensure accuracy.

- **Advanced Error Handling**: Develop robust mechanisms to manage potential API errors or data inconsistencies.

- **Brand-Specific Filtering**: Introduce options to filter data collection based on specific gift card brands (e.g., Amazon, Walmart) for targeted analysis.
